Pintos Kernel
-------------

This kernel is a project for Stanford University's CS112/CS212 program. 
It's a teaching operating system that uses a single kernel. 
We'll implement it from four modules:
    /threads
    /userprog
    /vm
    /filesys

The documentation directory contains my own design documents, which try
to follow Stanford's rules. I also refer to and read the source code of 
similar open source operating systems such as Linux, as well as some papers.
