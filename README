Pintos Kernel
-------------

this kernel is a project for stanford university's cs112/cs212. 
It's a teaching operating system that uses a Monolithic kernel. 
We'll implement it from four modules:
    /threads
    /userprog
    /vm
    /filesys

According to Stanford University's rules, you need to find
two people to form a team to complete this project.
Since it is difficult to find teammates and teaching assistants
when studying on your own, I will use LLM as my partner.
Of course, the premise is to abide by the rules and not abuse LLM.
My code is to only use LLM to answer OS concepts and code snippets that
I find difficult to understand.
I also refer to and read the source code of similar open source
operating systems such as Linux, as well as some papers.

Notes: Regarding Dockerfile, when I was configuring the Pintos environment,
I started to refer to many solutions on the Internet, but there were
incompatibility issues or Docker image stuck issues. I spent half
a day to build a relatively rough environment configuration.
I cannot guarantee that many of them are correct.
Please carefully identify them when using them.

Wranning: Please try to use qemu when developing in docker.
