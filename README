Pintos Kernel
-------------

this kernel is a project for stanford university's cs112/cs212. 
It's a teaching operating system that uses a Monolithic kernel. 
We'll implement it from four modules:
    /threads
    /userprog
    /vm
    /filesys

The documentation directory contains my own design documents, which try
to follow Stanford's rules. I also refer to and read the source code of 
similar open source operating systems such as Linux, as well as some papers.

Notes: Regarding Dockerfile, when I was configuring the Pintos environment,
I started to refer to many solutions on the Internet, but there were
incompatibility issues or Docker image stuck issues. I spent half
a day to build a relatively rough environment configuration.
I cannot guarantee that many of them are correct.
Please carefully identify them when using them.

Wranning: Please try to use qemu when developing in docker.
